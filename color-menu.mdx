# The Color Wheel

The Color Wheel can be interacted with to choose new colors, and there is also an input box to copy and paste hex codes, if preferred. The large color block below the Wheel displays the currently selected color (shown above in purple), and the small rectangle on the right, (shown above in black) is the secondary color that can be swapped with the purple by either clicking the small box of black, or use keyboard shortcut X.

Below this, you can adjust the background color of your canvas to whatever is the currently selected color.

# The Color Palette

Any time a new color is introduced to any of your frames via a reference image, or by selecting and using a color from the color wheel, a swatch will appear in the Palette below the Color Wheel. 

- A swatch can be clicked to be selected, dragged to be reordered, and double clicked to change the currently selected color to this swatch.
- You are able to globally change any palette colors by selecting the swatch you want to change, then selecting the new color you want to change it to, and hitting the "Change Color" button.
- Although we do our best to preprocess any imported images, sometimes multiple similar palette swatches will populate due to variation. The Simplify Palette button will find any near neighboring colors and merge them into one color.
- you can shift select multiple swatches, and you can use the select all button. The delete color button will delete any selected colors.
