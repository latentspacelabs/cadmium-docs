# Exporting Frames

When you have finished the coloring process, you can export your frames either by hitting the Export button in the lower right corner, or by selecting the menu item File/Exportâ€¦

Which ever layers are currently visibile in your timeline is what will export.

If you need to export all of your individual colors separately for your compositing process, you can do so by selecting the arrow on the Export button and selecting "Export Colors Separated"

This will export each individual palette color into its own separate folder in your specified location.
