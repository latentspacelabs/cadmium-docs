## **About Cadmium**

Cadmium was developed to help traditional animators digitally color their line frames.

## Key Features

The main processes of Cadmium are:

- **Importing your line artwork:** Import your line artwork as numbered .png sequences with an alpha channel
- **Providing a reference frame**: Either import or create a reference frame within Cadmium to define the color of each segment on your image
- **Analyzing Frames:** This step is necessary in order to colorize, and it defines a "segment map" of your line image, which defines all boundaries of different areas on the image that are able to be colored uniquely.
- **Colorizing**: Based on your reference image, Cadmium will make predictions about color choices for uncolored frames. This can be done sequentially, or one at a time.
- **Exporting:** When you are done coloring, Cadmium allows you to export your work to be integrated back into your pipeline. Each color can be exported separately, if desired.
