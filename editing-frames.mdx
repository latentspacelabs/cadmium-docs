# Editing Line Frames

After analyzing your frames, you may find some gaps in your line work. In addition to adjusting the [Analyze Settings](/analyzing-frames), you can use the Pen/Eraser tool to make any manual adjustments. Make sure that you have the Line Layer selected, and then select the Pen tool to adjust. 

# Editing Color Frames

When the Color layer is selected, you can use the pen tool and the fill tool to edit your color frame. You can also manually change the color of segments using the fill tool. See the [Drawing Tools](/drawing-tools) section for more information about this.
